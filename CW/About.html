                <h2>About This Project</h2>

                <h3>3D Models</h3>
                <p>For my 3D App, I created three original 3D models in <strong>Blender</strong>:
                    a <strong>teapot with cups</strong>, an <strong>iPod Nano</strong>, and a <strong>DJ booth with vinyls</strong>.
                    I made all the textures myself, except for the vinyl labels and album cover images, which I sourced externally.
                    Each model was exported as a <code>.glb</code> file to maintain material and animation compatibility.
                </p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>I designed the site, using images, gifs and fonts from the web to resemble a <strong>2000s-era website</strong>, using CSS and Javascript.
                    JavaScript handles most of the interactivity, including hover effects and audio playback for a retro tech vibe.
                </p>

                <h3>Integration</h3>
                <p>I used <strong>Three.js</strong> to display and animate the models. 
                    Audio clips were edited and synced to animations using <strong>CapCut</strong>, then embedded in the site.
                    Additional images and text appear contextually based on the active model.
                </p>

                <h3>Interaction</h3>
                <p>The models can be rotated and zoomed using <strong>OrbitControls</strong>. 
                    JavaScript buttons allow users to toggle wireframe views, swap models, and trigger animations or sounds. These were part of the requirements. 
                    I added further interactions such as button hovers, and sounds designed to support the 2000s aesthetic.
                </p>

                <h3>Implementation</h3>
                <p>The project uses <strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Three.js</strong>. 
                    I organized assets into folders and tested functionality in Chrome and Firefox. 
                    Interactions are handled manually via JavaScript for flexibility and custom control.
                </p>

                <h3>Deeper Understanding</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I created original 3D models from scratch and applied my own textures.</li>
                    <li>I built a fully custom UI with JavaScript and CSS.</li>
                    <li>I synced animation and sound externally in CapCut, then integrated them precisely.</li>
                    <li>I designed the entire experience to follow a nostalgic web aesthetic with purposefully styled interactions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Publication & Testing</h3>
                <p> 
                I have tested the zipped folder in Visual Studio Code and confirmed that the site loads correctly. 
                All assets and scripts work as intended on the university's web server.
                I tested my 3D website in Chrome to make sure that the rendering of models, animations, and audio was working fine. There were testing sessions in week 11, where I only had a wireframe of the website. The feedback I received for the wireframe was that the layout was nice visually, so that is present throughout all of the webpages. During the testing that took place after, I received feedback that the layout felt a bit cramped, so I adjusted the sizes. Some testers also found the background colour too bright when combined with the text, so I tweaked the contrast and font weight to improve readability.
